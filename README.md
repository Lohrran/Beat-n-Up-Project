## Introduction
The game was interally made for me on my second semestre in the college it kinda had complex mechanics for a merely student at time to implement, but after hours and nights without sleep I could make it ðŸ˜Ž.

## Project
It's about an alligator who need beat up his way to the top of the build. The player could punch, walk, run, and dodge away from the enemies. The game had a large variations of enemies and bosses.
